The given problem is to fill out the script such that it always prints "success" while adhering to specific constraints. The key challenge lies in the random rotation of the list after each step, which makes it impossible to guarantee that all elements have been inspected and modified within the allowed number of steps.

To ensure that the program always prints "success," we need to manipulate the list in such a way that all elements become either True or False within the given steps. However, due to the random rotations and the constraint of inspecting no more than two elements per iteration, it's impossible to deterministically achieve this goal.

Here's the reasoning:

    Random Rotation: After each step, the list is rotated by a random amount between 0 and 3 positions. This means that the positions of the elements change unpredictably, and we cannot control which elements we inspect in the next step.

    Limited Inspection: We can inspect and modify only up to two elements per iteration. Given that there are four elements, and we have six iterations, there's no guarantee that we'll inspect all elements, especially since rotations are random.

    Deterministic Solution: The problem requires a deterministic solution that doesn't rely on probability. We cannot assume that over six iterations, we'll have inspected all elements due to the randomness introduced by rotations.

Given these constraints, it's impossible to fill out the script to always print "success" deterministically. Therefore, the appropriate response is to acknowledge the impossibility under the given constraints.

def puzzle(bools):
    # It's impossible to ensure success under the given constraints.
    return "failure"
