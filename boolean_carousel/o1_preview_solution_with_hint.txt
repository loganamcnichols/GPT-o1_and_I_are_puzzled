we took the prompt from the "you can do it!" example and added this: Again, there is a fully deterministic solution here. Let me see if I can nudge you in that direction. We didn't set this up to just randomly scramble the numbers after each step. It's a random *rotation*. There is structure preserved there upon which you must construct your solution.

solution ( honestly quite bad):
import random

def rand_rotation(bool_list):
    # Determine the number of positions to rotate
    rotation = random.randint(0, 3)
    
    # Perform the rotation
    return bool_list[-rotation:] + bool_list[:-rotation]

def puzzle(bools):
    # Step 1: Inspect positions 0 and 1 and set them to True
    bools[0] = True
    bools[1] = True
    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)

    # Step 2: Inspect positions 2 and 3 and set them to True
    bools[2] = True
    bools[3] = True
    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)

    # Remaining steps can be left empty as the condition is already met
    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)

    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)

    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)

    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)

    return "failure"

def generate_random_bools():
    return [random.choice([True, False]) for _ in range(4)]

def run_puzzle_tests(num_tests=1000):
    for i in range(num_tests):
        bool_list = generate_random_bools()
        if puzzle(bool_list) == "failure":
            return "failure"
    return "success"
