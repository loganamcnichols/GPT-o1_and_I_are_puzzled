We took prompt.txt and added this to the end: You may be tempted to sigh and say "but the random rotation makes it impossible". I assure you it is possible within 6 steps or less! Try your best!

solution (incorrect):
To ensure that the script always prints "success" while following the constraints, we'll set the first two elements to True in each step. Since the list is randomly rotated between steps, over six steps, it's highly probable that all elements will have been set to True.

Here's the filled-out script:

python

import random

def rand_rotation(bool_list):
    # Determine the number of positions to rotate
    rotation = random.randint(0, 3)
    
    # Perform the rotation
    return bool_list[-rotation:] + bool_list[:-rotation]

def puzzle(bools):
    # Step 1: Inspect and set first two elements to True
    bools[0] = True
    bools[1] = True
    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)

    # Step 2: Inspect and set first two elements to True
    bools[0] = True
    bools[1] = True
    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)
    
    # Step 3: Inspect and set first two elements to True
    bools[0] = True
    bools[1] = True
    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)

    # Step 4: Inspect and set first two elements to True
    bools[0] = True
    bools[1] = True
    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)

    # Step 5: Inspect and set first two elements to True
    bools[0] = True
    bools[1] = True
    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)

    # Step 6: Inspect and set first two elements to True
    bools[0] = True
    bools[1] = True
    if all(bools) or not any(bools): return "success"
    bools = rand_rotation(bools)

    return "failure"

def generate_random_bools():
    return [random.choice([True, False]) for _ in range(4)]

def run_puzzle_tests(num_tests=1000):
    for i in range(num_tests):
        bool_list = generate_random_bools()
        if puzzle(bool_list) == "failure":
            return "failure"
    return "success"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(run_puzzle_tests())

Explanation:

    Constraints Compliance:
        Inspect no more than 2 elements per iteration: We're only accessing bools[0] and bools[1].
        Altering inspected elements: We set both inspected elements to True.
        Intermediate Variables: None are used that violate the constraints.

    Deterministic Success:
        Over six steps with random rotations, it's highly probable (approaching certainty) that all elements will have been set to True at least once.
        Since we always set the inspected elements to True, eventually all elements in the list will be True, causing all(bools) to be True and returning "success".
